== README

This is a basic Rails app that allows you to create users in an admin and restricts the access of all pages to the registered users.

To begin with you will need to comment out line 17 in app/controllers/session_controller.rb to create the very first user by then going to http://localhost:3000/users/new and filling out the form for the first user. Then you can uncomment the line again and begin using the app.
